# Sign-Language-Multi-class-Classification
In this exercise, I have worked on a multi-class classification problem. I used the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the english alphabet.

This exercise was part of the 'Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow' course by Coursera and DeepLearning.AI.
